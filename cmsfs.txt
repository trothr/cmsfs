WARNING:  The "driver" function included in this package 
is untested,  and since drivers run in kernel space,  there is risk. 
The "utility" function is safer because it runs in user space. 
(I have not completed updating the driver since we crossed 
the 2.2.x to 2.4.x line.   Working on it!) 
 
This is the README file for the CMS Filesystem driver and utility.
This file may also be found under the name cmsfs.txt.
 
ALL TEXT FILES IN THIS PACKAGE
have tab characters expanded for the purpose of "eat your own cookin",
specifically that the package may be maintained on CMS, where tabs
function as expected but are a hassle.   (It's an XEDIT thing.)
 
This filesystem driver and utility is for the CMS "minidisk" filesystem,
referred to as "EDF" in IBM's VM/ESA operating system (the CMS component).
There was previously a "CDF" format which is not supported.
 
Done in the 1.0 release:
 
        'cmsfsvol' ---- report on a CMS volume in CMS 'Q DISK' format
        'cmsfslst' ---- list CMS files in CMS 'LISTFILE' format
        'cmsfscat' ---- conCATenate one or more CMS files to stdout
        'cmsfsck' ----- filesystem check for CMS vols (aka: fsck.cmsfs)
        'cmsfscp' ----- copy CMS files, preserving time stamps
        libcmsfs.a ---- "archive" library for user space (utility) mode
        cmsfs.o ------- the FS driver, for 'mount -t cms' to work
 
The following objectives are not in the package as of 1.x:
 
        'cmsfsls' ----- Unix style listing (already have CMS style)
        R/W capability
        globbing in the utility
        varying file conversion
 
NOT SUPPORTED:  CDF (old CMS minidisk format),
                hierarchical directories (sub-directories)
                LFS volumes (LAN File Services; aka PWS volumes)
 
As of 2000-Sep-08 all source files in this package
are processed  *by*  this package.  That is,  they reside on a
CMS minidisk hosted by VM/ESA, shared R/O with a Linux/390 guest,
and copied to Linux storage using previously built CMS FS utilities.
Once new sources are copied,  fresh executables are built from those,
and the cycle continues.   This is good for QA.   This further means
that many of the sources are maintained with CMS XEDIT,  for those
who are interested in such things  (and you know who you are!).
 
It seems reasonable for a filesystem driver to be able to reside
in the filesystem type it supports.   So it is with this package.
This leads to some funny names in the source directory.
Please accept that as an artifact of committment to quality.
 
As of 2001-Feb-18 (0.9.17) the driver is in a usable state.
 
Exceptions abound:  Linux "dasd" driver does not flush its buffers,
so we have to re-IPL to get new CMS content,  so we don't do this
as often as we would like.
 
utility functions:
        cmsfs_vopen(), cmsfs_vclose()
        cmsfs_fopen(), cmsfs_fclose()
        cmsfs_open(), cmsfs_close()
 
driver functions:
        cmsfs_mount(), cmsfs_umount()
        cmsfs_init(), cmsfs_cleanup()
        init_module(), cleanup_module()
 
common functions:
        cmsfs_map_ADT()
        cmsfs_map_FST()
        cmsfs_map_EXT()
        cmsfs_read(), cmsfs_lookup()
 
functions with different code depending on the mode:
        cmsfs_error()
        cmsfs_bread()
        cmsfs_malloc()
        cmsfs_free()
