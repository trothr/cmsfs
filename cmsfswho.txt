Thanks to ...

        CMS minidisk (EDF) filesystem specifications taken from
        http://www.vm.ibm.com/pubs/cms630/FSTD.HTML,
        http://www.vm.ibm.com/pubs/cms630/ADTSECT.HTML,
        and the Linux kernel patches supplied by IBM (mdisk driver).

        Thanks to Dave Hilbe for supporting this project.

        Thanks to Arty Ecock <ECKCU@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU> for pointing me
        back at ADT after I had misunderstood it in my first look.

        Thanks to Rob van der Heij for help with the logic.

        Thanks to Neale Ferguson for "cpint".

        Thanks to Willem Konynenberg <wfk@xos.nl>
        for moral support and championing correct DASD I/O.

        Thanks to Alan Cox for help figuring out Linux VFS.

        Thanks to Reed Mullen for clarifying permission to use doc.

        Thanks to Marilyn Troth for advice about packaging,  helping
        me stay focused,  and for putting up with all the late nights.

        ... and many others whom I am sorry to have omitted.

I looked at every filesystem driver in the Linux 2.2.16 source
in researching the CMS FS driver,  particularly  ext2, isofs,  and the
fat, vfat, and msdos  family.   I looked at GNU Fileutiles source
in researching the CMS FS utility.
